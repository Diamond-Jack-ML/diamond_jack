<p>Stack Fluent is the name of the autonomous agent protocol that uses documentation, user data, use cases and existing projects to identity dependencies and the ideal technologies to use for any given task described in natural language. The goal is to provide a scalable architecture for software development that maintains a directory of facilities of the software, programming language or technology that can be used in a logical data model implementation of some conceptual data model.<br /><br />The philosophical basis is:<br /><br /><u>Efficiency:</u> Use work that&rsquo;s already been done at every level possible (entire pieces of software, functions, code snippets, etc.) as a minimum viable product and then move towards implementing a custom solution.</p><p><u>Modularity:</u> Keep all facilities and their descriptions organized into the appropriate categories for easy reuse.<br /><u>Foresight:</u> Infer potential future dependencies based on all available information about the type of task or project.<br /><u>Inclusivity:</u> Use existing facilities of a particular technology to infer their utility in a given domain. Use this to improve existing workflows.<br /><u>CI/CD:</u> Let existing features of your system inform the refinement of the conceptual model, which then gets implemented as new features.</p><p /><p><u>AI Agent Workflow</u></p><ol start="1"><li><p>Pick software based on certain selection criteria.</p></li><li><p>List facilities of software.</p></li><li><p>See if any of the facilities can be used to improve existing processes.</p></li><li><p>Update workflows.</p></li><li><p>Implement as library of functions written for REST API of that software</p></li></ol><h3>1. <strong>Define the Scope and Objectives</strong></h3><ul><li><p>Determine the types of open-source software you want to include (e.g., web applications, libraries, frameworks).</p></li><li><p>Define what constitutes a &quot;new service&quot; in your context.</p></li></ul><h3>2. <strong>GitHub Data Mining</strong></h3><ul><li><p>Use the GitHub API to fetch data about open-source repositories.</p></li><li><p>Criteria might include stars, forks, language, dependencies, etc.</p></li></ul><h3>3. <strong>Repository Analysis</strong></h3><ul><li><p>Analyze the software in each repository.</p></li><li><p>Extract key information like functionality, dependencies, and compatibility.</p></li></ul><h3>4. <strong>Compatibility and Synergy Assessment</strong></h3><ul><li><p>Develop algorithms to assess compatibility between different software (e.g., language, framework, license compatibility).</p></li><li><p>Identify potential synergies between software functionalities.</p></li></ul><h3>5. <strong>Idea Generation Engine</strong></h3><ul><li><p>Design an algorithm that suggests combinations of software based on the assessed compatibilities and synergies.</p></li><li><p>Include filters for user-defined criteria (e.g., specific functionalities, performance constraints).</p></li></ul><h3>6. <strong>User Interface</strong></h3><ul><li><p>Develop a user-friendly interface for users to explore and customize suggestions.</p></li><li><p>Consider features like search filters, detailed software descriptions, and potential use-case scenarios.</p></li></ul><h3>7. <strong>Feedback and Iteration</strong></h3><ul><li><p>Implement a feedback system to refine suggestions based on user input and successful combinations.</p></li></ul><h3>8. <strong>Testing and Refinement</strong></h3><ul><li><p>Test the tool with real-world scenarios.</p></li><li><p>Continuously refine algorithms based on testing results and user feedback.</p></li></ul><h3>9. <strong>Documentation and Community Engagement</strong></h3><ul><li><p>Create comprehensive documentation for your tool.</p></li><li><p>Engage with the open-source community for beta testing and collaborative improvements.</p></li></ul><h3>Technical Considerations:</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Machine Learning</strong>: Utilize ML techniques for pattern recognition and predictive modeling.</p></li><li><p><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</strong>: Analyze repository descriptions, readmes, and other textual data for better understanding of software functionalities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Graph Theory</strong>: Represent software and their dependencies as a graph for advanced analysis and visualization.</p></li></ul><h3>Challenges and Considerations:</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Quality Assurance</strong>: Ensuring that the suggested combinations are viable and useful.</p></li><li><p><strong>Scalability</strong>: Handling a large and constantly evolving database of open-source software.</p></li><li><p><strong>Legal and Licensing Issues</strong>: Respecting software licenses and legal restrictions in combinations.</p></li></ul><h3>Collaboration and Community Input:</h3><ul><li><p>Encourage contributions and suggestions from the open-source community.</p></li><li><p>Open-source the tool itself for collaborative improvements and trust-building.</p></li></ul><p><br /></p>
