<p><span style="color: rgb(151,160,175);">The target market is defined through a process of successive filtering with several possible initial conditions:</span></p><p /><p>1.) List all ideal clients<br />2.) Find ways that AI can help them<br /><br />1.) List all problems that can be solved with AI<br />2.) Find customers who fit that need<br />3.) Filter by desired customers<br /><br />1.) List all problems that can be solved with AI<br />2.) Filter by technical constraints ideal for x production value (efficient, valuable, quick, etc.)<br />3.) Find customers who fit that need<br />4.) Filter by desired customers.</p><p /><p>1.) Find all problems that can be solved by simple combination of services<br />2.) Sort by market size<br />3.) Sort by value</p><p /><p>1.) Start with a set of well-defined steps of sufficient complexity to warrant a service or product. For example, Excel sheets to Dash with the same row/column matrix will be converted to Dash in the same way in every case. Find leverage points where straightforward, deterministic instructions map to extrapolating out into something useful.<br />2.) Find all products that can be created using that.<br />3.) Find customers with that need<br />4.) Filter by desired customers</p><p /><p>1.) Start with dashboards<br />2.) Find customers who would use them<br /><br /><br /></p><p /><p /><p /><p /><p />
